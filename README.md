# Portfolio 3.0 - React Portfolio

## Description
After an introduction to React, I decided to go back and edit my bootstrapped portfolio to incoprorate React features.
Currently, the website uses React, but is not utilising it as much as I would like. This project was mostly used to get me familiar with the structure and the basics.

## Challenges Faced

### Importing / Exporting Elements
Making sure the groundwork is layed so each component gets the necessary data to render. 

## To Do

- Manage the routes set the website so it's one screen size and you're able to navigate to each section of the CV via routing
- Styling improvements. The current styling is basic and unproffesional. I intend to go back and tweak in the very near future before I activley search for jobs.
- Introduce state / prop functions to make the site more efficent (DRY!)

## Installation

Run the website by following the GitGub Pages link:
